# CAGD Course Project (CS236716 @Technion)

This project is the complete, unified, and final submission for the CAGD course (CS236716) at Technion. It includes two solutions: `cagd` and `demo`.

## Solutions Overview

### CAGD Solution

This version of cagdkit (cagdkit2008) is adapted to MS VC9 (2008). It is designed as a basic graphic utility for use in the CAGD course.

**Contents:**
- **CAGD Library**: 
  - Sources: `\src`
  - Header: `\include`
  - Library: `\Release` or `\Debug`
- **Demo**: An example application using the library, serving as a starting point for your own programs.
- **Documentation**: Short documentation of the library and the demo.

### Demo Solution

This is a C application developed entirely by me. It includes:

- **Parametric Curves**:
  - Displaying fernet system and animation along the curve
  - Parametric transformation
  - Dynamic change of given function
  - Displaying offsets and evolution curves
  - Displaying more geometric properties
  - (For full specifications, see HW1 document)

- **B-Spline/Bezier Curves**:
  - Editing, adding, and removing knots
  - Clamping B-splines
  - Refinement of B-splines
  - 3D drawing, editing, and more
  - (For full specifications, see HW2 document)

- **B-Spline/Bezier Surface Patches**:
  - Editing, adding, and removing patches
  - Spanning surface from 2 splines
  - Displaying surface geometry properties intuitively
  - Refinement of surfaces
  - (For full specifications, see HW3 document)

**Note**: This application does not contain sufficient documentation due to time constraints, but it will be updated in the future.

## Additional Information

- **CAGD Solution**: Supplied with minor tweaks implemented by me.
- **Demo Solution**: Completely produced by me.
- all HW files are inside "specifications" folder
